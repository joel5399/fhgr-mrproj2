# Hardware / 3D Models

Various parts of the robot have been 3D printed. The original files from Fusion as well as the exported
STEP models have been added here so that you can print them yourselves as well.

Additionally, you will need the following hardware components to completely reproduce the project:

* Two DC motors, we used the
  [JGA25-370 Motor](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Seeed%20Technology/114090046_Web.pdf)
  which we salvaged from two of our previously used
  [YFROBOT 4WD chassis](https://yfrobot.com/products/steering-gear-robot), including the mounting bracket (also salvaged
  from this kit)
* One servo motor
* One toy gun, we used the WLToys V959 Gattling Gun (an add-on for the quad-copter of the same name)
