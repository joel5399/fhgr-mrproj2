# SMT Model

## Creating the Model
The creation of this model was achieved using the Python script [fusion2urdf](https://github.com/syuntoku14/fusion2urdf) developed by [syuntoku14](https://github.com/syuntoku14)

To generate a model of your vehicle, start by designing it in Fusion360 and adding the necessary joints. Then, execute the Python script, and it will generate a complete package containing all the required files to launch your vehicle in Gazebo.
