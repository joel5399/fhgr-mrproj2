# PCB Schematics

The schematics have been created using the [EasyEDA editor](https://easyeda.com/editor), to load them you can open the
document via: Top menu - File - Open - EasyEDA... , and select the json file.
Once you open it in the editor you can save it into a project.

Note that the schematics as provided here still has a bug and required us to solder on a few wires! You should fix this
before ordering a new PCB with these schematics!
