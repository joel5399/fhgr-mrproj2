# How To Contribute

In order to contribute to this project, please:

* Ensure that you have set your `git config --global user.name` and `git config --global user.email` before committing
* Always use feature branches for anything you contribute (i.e. you shouldn't work on the `master` branch of your own
  fork)
* Always write [proper commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
  (also featured in the [Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project))
* Always work [in your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
* Follow the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
* Use [atomic commits](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/atomic-git-commits/)
  * Also follow this with your PRs: if two things are not related they should preferably not be in the same PR so that
    their reviews can happen in parallel and one doesn't block the other.

## For Code Contributions

When contributing code (rather than e.g. documentation):

* Make sure that your code builds
* Make sure to add test coverage (where reasonably possible)
* Make sure that it's properly documented (where applicable)
